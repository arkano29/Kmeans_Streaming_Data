# Kmeans_Streaming_Data
Code used for the short paper published in ICDM 2021 "K-means for Evolving Data Streams".

Experiments where originally run in clusters of a super-computer, these notebooks are the first user oriented approaches of our work. Hence, bugs may appear and we will work to fix them.

The datasets we used are public, and are available in the references we give in the extended version of the paper.

If you use or modify our code for research, please cite our paper:
